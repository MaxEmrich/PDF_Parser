# Outline:

This pdf parser will take in user input. The user input is a word, phrase, or sentence that
the pdf parser application will try to match with the pages of a user-uploaded pdf.

If the pdf parser matches the user input with a page (or pages) in the user-uploaded document,
the pdf parser will return a NEW PDF that contains ONLY the pages that matched with the user input.
